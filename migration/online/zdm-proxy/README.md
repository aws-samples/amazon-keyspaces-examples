# üöÄ ZDM Dual Write Proxy for Amazon Keyspaces Migration

This project extends the official [ ZDM Proxy](https://github.com/datastax/zdm-proxy) to support seamless **zero-downtime migration** from **Apache Cassandra** to **Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)** with AWS best practices. 

It introduces key enhancements:

- A custom Docker image hosted in **Amazon ECR** for VPC-accessible deployments.
- A **CloudFormation template** to deploy the proxy on **AWS Fargate**, ensuring a scalable, serverless, and secure setup within your existing AWS infrastructure.


The proxy is deployed with Amazon ECS on Fargate which can scale up and down based on application demand. The Network load balancer allows application traffic to be distributed across a number of ECS tasks.

## üìÅ Project Structure

| File                            | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Dockerfile`                    | Builds the custom ZDM Proxy image with Keyspaces-compatible networking and TLS support.                                      |
| `entrypoint.sh`                 | Entry script for the container. Resolves DNS, manages proxy routing via `socat`, and sets environment variables dynamically. |
| `move-docker-to-ecr.sh`         | Automates Docker image build, tagging, and pushing to Amazon ECR. Also downloads the required TLS root cert.                 |
| `zdm-proxy-cloudformation.yaml` | CloudFormation template for deploying the proxy as a Fargate task behind an NLB in a private VPC.                            |

## üõ†Ô∏è Parameters (CloudFormation Template)

### üîå Network Configuration

- **VPCId**: ID of your target VPC.
- **PrivateSubnetIds**: List of private subnet IDs.
- **SecurityGroupId**: Security Group for the Network Load Balancer.
- **RouteTableId**: Optional; for route management if using PrivateLink.

### üîÑ Origin & Target Cassandra Config

- **ZDMOriginContactPoints**, **ZDMTargetContactPoints**: IP/DNS for the clusters.
- **ZDMOriginPort**, **ZDMTargetPort**: Usually 9042 for Cassandra, 9142 for Amazon Keyspaces.
- **ZDMOriginUsername/Password**, **ZDMTargetUsername/Password**: Auth credentials.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Proxy Config

- **ServiceReplicaCount**: Number of ECS tasks to launch.
- **ZDMProxyPort**: Port for the proxy service. Default is `14002`.

## üì¶ Deployment Instructions

### 1. üß± Build and Push Image

```bash
./move-docker-to-ecr.sh
```

### 2. ‚òÅÔ∏è Launch CloudFormation Stack

Upload the `zdm-proxy-cloudformation.yaml` to S3 or the AWS Console and deploy it. Provide required parameters (e.g., subnets, contact points).

---

## üîê Security and TLS

- TLS is handled via Amazon Keyspaces' default requirement. The proxy ensures secure, in-transit communication.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Amazon Keyspaces

- Uses **port 9142** for CQL over TLS as required by Amazon Keyspaces.
- Supports **DNS-based discovery** of Amazon Keyspaces via `entrypoint.sh`.
- Deployable **entirely within a VPC** for added security and compliance.

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

Once deployed:

- Point your application to the NLB DNS created by the CloudFormation stack.
- Test dual writes by verifying data in both origin and target clusters.
