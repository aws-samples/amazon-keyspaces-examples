## About this Repo <a name="About"></a>
This repo is our official list of Amazon Keyspaces example code. The repo is subdivided into sections for each language (see ["Examples"](#Examples)). Each language has its own subsection of examples with the goal to achieve language parity (same subset of examples exist in each language). These examples demonstrate various common service implementations, or infrastructure patterns that could be useful in your use of Amazon Keyspaces when building your own infrastructure.

We welcome contributions to this repo in the form of fixes to existing examples or addition of new examples. For more information on contributing, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-keyspaces-examples/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

This is considered an intermediate learning resource and should typically be referenced after reading the Developer Guide (please see [Learning Resources](#Learning) for more information on these resources).
