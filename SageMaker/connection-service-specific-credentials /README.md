## Connecting to Amazon Keyspaces from SageMaker Notebook with Python


This code shows how to connect to Amazon Keyspaces from SageMaker using an [service-specific credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/programmatic.credentials.html) for an existing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user.

Service-specific credentials arenâ€™t the only way to authenticate and authorize access to Amazon Keyspaces resources. We recommend using the AWS authentication plugin for Cassandra drivers.

The following code is an example of a service-specific credential .

```
"ServiceSpecificCredential": {
        "CreateDate": "2019-10-09T16:12:04Z",
        "ServiceName": "cassandra.amazonaws.com",
        "ServiceUserName": "keyspace-user1-at-11122223333",
        "ServicePassword": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
        "ServiceSpecificCredentialId": "ACCAYFI33SINPGJEBYESF",
        "UserName": " keyspace-user1",
        "Status": "Active"
    }
}
```



### Prerequisites<a name="Prerequisites"></a></a>
This notebook was tested with conda_python3 kernel and should work with Python 3.x.

The Notebook execution role must include permissions to access Amazon Keyspaces and Assume the role.

*  To access Amazon Keyspaces database - can use AmazonKeyspacesReadOnlyAccess or AmazonKeyspacesFullAccess managed policies. Use the least privilege approach for your production application.
[AWS Identity and Access Management for Amazon Keyspaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/security-iam.html)

* To assume the role you need to have [sts:AssumeRole action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) permissions
    ```
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",  
      "Statement": [  
        {  
           "Action": [  
           "sts:AssumeRole"  
          ],  
          "Effect": "Allow",  
          "Resource": "*"  
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

#### Note:
Amazon Keyspaces is available in the following [AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/programmatic.endpoints.html)


### Running the sample
*  Import Notebook into SageMaker
