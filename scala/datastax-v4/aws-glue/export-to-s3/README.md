## Using Glue Export Example
This example provides scala script for exporting Amazon Keyspaces table data to S3 using AWS Glue. This allows you to export data from Amazon Keyspaces without setting up a spark cluster.

## Prerequisites
* Setup Spark Cassandra connector using provided [setup script](../)

### Setup Export to S3
The following script sets up AWS Glue job to export a Keyspaces table to S3. The script takes the following parameters 
* PARENT_STACK_NAME is the stack name used to create the spark cassandra connector with Glue. [setup script](../)
* EXPORT_STACK_NAME is the stack name used to create export glue job. 
* KEYSPACE_NAME and TABLE_NAME Keyspaces and table is the fully qualified name of the table you wish to export.
* S3URI is the S3 uri where the data will be exported. By default it will use the s3 bucket from the parent stack. 
* FORMAT can be json, csv, or parquet. parquet is recommended for ease of use with data loading, transformations, and using exports with Athena. default is parquet. 

```shell
./setup-export.sh SETUP_STACK_NAME EXPORT_STACK_NAME KEYSPACE_TABLE TABLE_NAME 

```

Optionally, you may also provide the S3URI, FORMAT. Later you can change parameters on job run.

```shell
./setup-export.sh SETUP_STACK_NAME EXPORT_STACK_NAME KEYSPACE_TABLE TABLE_NAME S3URI FORMAT

```


By default the export will copy data to S3 bucket specified in the parent stack in the format. You can override the S3 bucket at run time.  The data below used in the example will be replaced with the time of the export

```shell
    \--- S3_BUCKET
            \------- jars
            \------- conf
            \------- scripts
            \------- spark-logs
            \------- export
                \----- keyspace_name
                    \----- table_name
                       \----- snapshot
                           \----- year=2025 
                               \----- month=01
                                  \----- day=02
                                      \----- hour=09
                                          \----- minute=22
                                              \--- YOUR DATA HERE

``` 

### Running the export from the CLI

Running the job can be done through the AWS CLI. In the following example the command is running the job created in the previous step, but overrides the number of glue workers, worker type, and script arguments such as the table name. You can override any of the glue job parameters at run time and the default arguments. 

```shell
aws glue start-job-run --job-name AmazonKeyspacesExportToS3-aksglue-aksglue-export --number-of-workers 8 --worker-type G.2X --arguments '{"--TABLE_NAME":"transactions"}'
```

### List of export script arguments

| argument          | defenition                                      | default |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | ----: |
| --KEYSPACE_NAME   |   Name of the keyspace of the table to export   | 23.99 |
| --TABLE_NAME      |   Name of the table to export                   | 23.99 |
| --S3_URI          |  S3 URI where the root of the export will be located. The folder structure is added dynamically in the export-sample.scala       | The default location is the s3 bucked provided when setting up the parent stack or the export stack |
| --FORMAT          |  THe format of the export. Its recommended to use parquet. You could alternativley use json or other types supported by spark s3 libraries | parquet
| --DRIVER_CONF     |  the file containing the driver configuration.  | By default the parent stack sets up a config for Cassandra and config for keyspaces. You can add as many additional configurations as you like by dropping them in the same location in s3. | keyspaces-application.conf


### Scheduled Trigger (Cron)
You can trigger this export regularly using a scheduled trigger.  Here is a simple AWS CLI command to create a Glue Trigger that runs your Glue job Export once per week (every Monday at 12:00 UTC):

```shell
  aws glue create-trigger \
  --name KeyspacesExportWeeklyTrigger \
  --type SCHEDULED \
  --schedule "cron(0 12 ? * MON *)" \
  --start-on-creation \
  --actions '[{
     "JobName": "AmazonKeyspacesExportToS3-aksglue-aksglue-export",
     "Arguments": {
       "--number-of-workers": "8",
       "--worker-type": "G.2X",
       "--table_name": "transactions",
       "--keyspace_name": "aws"
     }
  }]'
  ```
